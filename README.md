# Guess the Language

This is a simple trivia game in which the user has 10 seconds to read a string of text and guess what languages it is in.

## About this Game

Game accessible [here](https://kathdovi.github.io/TriviaGame/).

### Playing the Game

The user starts by pressing the start button. Then, they are presented with a phrase in a language other than English which they are prompted to identify by selecting it from one of the 4 options. The user is timed and only has 10 seconds per question. If the user selects the right answer, they are presented with a screen that tells them they are correct. Conversely, if the user selects the wrong answer, they are presented with a screen that tells them they are incorrect. Finally, if the user does not select an answer before the timer for each question is up, they are presented with a screen that tells them they ran out of time. These screens hold for 3 seconds, then the user is presented with a screen that gives them their statistics and lets them retry the game if they would like.
